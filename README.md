An entry for National Novel Generation Month 2014

Copy index.html to your local hard drive and drag it into any browser window to see the output. Change the `seed` value to a different number to generate a different novel.

The language generated here resembles Hawaiian, since it uses the same character ranges and follows some of the basic rules. 

Profane or obscene language may appear; kindly accept my apologies in advance, and note that any opinions expressed by the generating function are its own, and not that of its author.

Sample output is also in this repo as honu_8675309.txt. I used 8675309 for the default random seed because it's my lucky number.
